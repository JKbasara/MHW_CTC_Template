# MHW_CTC_Template
Binary Template for the 010 Editor that allows for jigglebone physics editing in Monster Hunter: World

_This template was created by Karbon, my limitless thanks goes to them!_

***
This file requires the 010 Editor found here: https://www.sweetscape.com/010editor/

To use it, follow these steps:
1. Open up the 010 Editor, go to the upper toolbar, and pick "Templates > View Installed Templates"
2. Press the Add button and locate the "CTC_Template.bt".
3. Once added, hit OK to return to the software.
4. Now that the template is saved, any time you open a .ctc file of your choosing and press F5, you can select the CTC_Template option. 
6. The hex window should now be colored and a result window pops up to allow modification.

Have fun!

***
ICEBORNE UPDATE:
- Template now reads updated bones properly (they added a 16 byte line to the end of all bones and changed the 5th byte in the header)
- Color coded important parts of bones.
- Added section on bones for their collision radius.

_Thank you to Ice for finding the new hex!_
